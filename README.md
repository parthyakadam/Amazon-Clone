This repository contains a clone of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon, built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. The project aims to replicate key features of Amazon's user interface, providing a hands-on example of modern web development practices.

## Features

- **Product Listings:** Browse a wide range of products, including images, descriptions, prices, and ratings. The product data is fetched from a mock API for demonstration purposes.

- **Product Details:** Clicking on a product takes the user to a detailed view with additional information.

- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the items in the cart, and update quantities or remove products.

- **Checkout Process:** Simulated the checkout process, with a summary of items, sub-toal and grand total cost.

In upcoming future, features like User Authentication, Payment Flow, Order History & Tracking, etx. can be added to make this app more robust and user-friendly.
## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** The project is built using the React.js library, allowing for efficient component-based UI development.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is accomplished using Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach for creating responsive and visually appealing designs.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is employed for state management, ensuring a predictable and organized way to handle application-wide data.

- **Axios:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the mock API, enabling seamless communication between the front-end and the back-end.

- **React Router:** The project utilizes React Router for handling client-side routing and navigation.
